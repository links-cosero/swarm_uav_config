This repository was build as a reference for the setup and simulation of a mission done by a drone using PX4 and ROS2. In order to correctly launch the mission scripts for the simulated UAV, we need to first install and configure some programs and packages.
This repo uses Px4 v1.14 (main version), MicroXRCE and Gazebo Garden.
